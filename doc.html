<u>FEATS</u><p></p>
<p></p>
PREREQUISITES<p></p>
Some feats have prerequisites. Your character must have the indicated ability score, class feature, feat, skill, base attack bonus, or other quality designated in order to select or use that feat. A character can gain a feat at the same level at which he or she gains the prerequisite.<p></p>
A character can&rsquo;t use a feat if he or she has lost a prerequisite.<p></p>
<p></p>
TYPES OF FEATS<p></p>
Some feats are general, meaning that no special rules govern them as a group. Others are item creation feats, which allow spellcasters to create magic items of all sorts. A metamagic feat lets a spellcaster prepare and cast a spell with greater effect, albeit as if the spell were a higher spell level than it actually is.<p></p>
<p></p>
FIGHTER BONUS FEATS<p></p>
Any feat designated as a fighter feat can be selected as a fighter&rsquo;s bonus feat. This designation does not restrict characters of other classes from selecting these feats, assuming that they meet any prerequisites.<p></p>
<p></p>
ITEM CREATION FEATS<p></p>
An item creation feat lets a spellcaster create a magic item of a certain type. Regardless of the type of items they involve, the various item creation feats all have certain features in common.<p></p>
<b>XP Cost:</b> Experience that the spellcaster would normally keep is expended when making a magic item. The XP cost equals 1/25 of the cost of the item in gold pieces. A character cannot spend so much XP on an item that he or she loses a level. However, upon gaining enough XP to attain a new level, he or she can immediately expend XP on creating an item rather than keeping the XP to advance a level.<p></p>
<b>Raw Materials Cost:</b> The cost of creating a magic item equals one-half the sale cost of the item.<p></p>
Using an item creation feat also requires access to a laboratory or magical workshop, special tools, and so on. A character generally has access to what he or she needs unless unusual circumstances apply.<p></p>
<b>Time:</b> The time to create a magic item depends on the feat and the cost of the item. The minimum time is one day.<p></p>
<b>Item Cost:</b> Brew Potion, Craft Wand, and Scribe Scroll create items that directly reproduce spell effects, and the power of these items depends on their caster levelthat is, a spell from such an item has the power it would have if cast by a spellcaster of that level. The price of these items (and thus the XP cost and the cost of the raw materials) also depends on the caster level. The caster level must be high enough that the spellcaster creating the item can cast the spell at that level. To find the final price in each case, multiply the caster level by the spell level, then multiply the result by a constant, as shown below:<p></p>
<i>Scrolls: </i>Base price = spell level x caster level x \u61472?25 gp.<p></p>
<i>Potions: </i>Base price = spell level x \u61472?caster level x \u61472?50 gp.<p></p>
<i>Wands: </i>Base price = spell level x \u61472?caster level x \u61472?750 gp.<p></p>
A 0-level spell is considered to have a spell level of 1/2 for the purpose of this calculation.<p></p>
<b>Extra Costs: </b>Any potion, scroll, or wand that stores a spell with a costly material component or an XP cost also carries a commensurate cost. For potions and scrolls, the creator must expend the material component or pay the XP cost when creating the item.<p></p>
For a wand, the creator must expend fifty copies of the material component or pay fifty times the XP cost.<p></p>
Some magic items similarly incur extra costs in material components or XP, as noted in their descriptions.<p></p>
<p></p>
METAMAGIC FEATS<p></p>
As a spellcaster&rsquo;s knowledge of magic grows, she can learn to cast spells in ways slightly different from the ways in which the spells were originally designed or learned. Preparing and casting a spell in such a way is harder than normal but, thanks to metamagic feats, at least it is possible.  Spells modified by a metamagic feat use a spell slot higher than normal. This does not change the level of the spell, so the DC for saving throws against it does not go up.<p></p>
<b>Wizards and Divine Spellcasters:</b> Wizards and divine spellcasters must prepare their spells in advance. During preparation, the character chooses which spells to prepare with metamagic feats (and thus which ones take up higher-level spell slots than normal).<p></p>
<b>Sorcerers and Bards:</b> Sorcerers and bards choose spells as they cast them. They can choose when they cast their spells whether to apply their metamagic feats to improve them. As with other spellcasters, the improved spell uses up a higher-level spell slot. But because the sorcerer or bard has not prepared the spell in a metamagic form in advance, he must apply the metamagic feat on the spot. Therefore, such a character must also take more time to cast a metamagic spell (one enhanced by a metamagic feat) than he does to cast a regular spell. If the spell&rsquo;s normal casting time is 1 action, casting a metamagic version is a full-round action for a sorcerer or bard. (This isn&rsquo;t the same as a 1-round casting time.)<p></p>
For a spell with a longer casting time, it takes an extra full-round action to cast the spell.<p></p>
<b>Spontaneous Casting and Metamagic Feats: </b>A cleric spontaneously casting a <i>cure </i>or <i>inflict </i>spell can cast a metamagic version of it instead. Extra time is also required in this case. Casting a 1-action metamagic spell spontaneously is a full-round action, and a spell with a longer casting time takes an extra full-round action to cast.<p></p>
<b>Effects of Metamagic Feats on a Spell:</b> In all ways, a metamagic spell operates at its original spell level, even though it is prepared and cast as a higher-level spell. Saving throw modifications are not changed unless stated otherwise in the feat description.<p></p>
The modifications made by these feats only apply to spells cast directly by the feat user. A spellcaster can&rsquo;t use a metamagic feat to alter a spell being cast from a wand, scroll, or other device.<p></p>
Metamagic feats that eliminate components of a spell don&rsquo;t eliminate the attack of opportunity provoked by casting a spell while threatened. However, casting a spell modified by Quicken Spell does not provoke an attack of opportunity.<p></p>
Metamagic feats cannot be used with all spells. See the specific feat descriptions for the spells that a particular feat can&rsquo;t modify.<p></p>
<p></p>
<b>Multiple Metamagic Feats on a Spell:</b> A spellcaster can apply multiple metamagic feats to a single spell. Changes to its level are cumulative. You can&rsquo;t apply the same metamagic feat more than once to a single spell.<p></p>
<p></p>
<b>Magic Items and Metamagic Spells:</b> With the right item creation feat, you can store a metamagic version of a spell in a scroll, potion, or wand. Level limits for potions and wands apply to the spell&rsquo;s higher spell level (after the application of the metamagic feat). A character doesn&rsquo;t need the metamagic feat to activate an item storing a metamagic version of a spell.<p></p>
<b>Counterspelling Metamagic Spells:</b> Whether or not a spell has been enhanced by a metamagic feat does not affect its vulnerability to counterspelling or its ability to counterspell another spell.<p></p>
<p></p>
FEAT DESCRIPTIONS<p></p>
Here is the format for feat descriptions.<p></p>
<p></p>
FEAT NAME [TYPE OF FEAT]<p></p>
<b>Prerequisite:</b> A minimum ability score, another feat or feats, a minimum base attack bonus, a minimum number of ranks in one or more skills, or a class level that a character must have in order to acquire this feat.

<b>Benefit:</b> What the feat enables the character (“you” in the feat description) to do. If a character has the same feat more than once, its benefits do not stack unless indicated otherwise in the description.<p></p>
In general, having a feat twice is the same as having it once.<p></p>
<b>Normal:</b> What a character who does not have this feat is limited to or restricted from doing. If not having the feat causes no particular drawback, this entry is absent.<p></p>
<b>Special: </b>Additional facts about the feat that may be helpful when you decide whether to acquire the feat.<p></p>

<b>Benefit:</b> In melee, every time you miss because of concealment, you can reroll your miss chance percentile roll one time to see if you actually hit.<p></p>
An invisible attacker gets no advantages related to hitting you in melee. That is, you don&rsquo;t lose your Dexterity bonus to Armor Class, and the attacker doesn&rsquo;t get the usual +2 bonus for being invisible. The invisible attacker&rsquo;s bonuses do still apply for ranged attacks, however.<p></p>
You take only half the usual penalty to speed for being unable to see. Darkness and poor visibility in general reduces your speed to three-quarters normal, instead of one-half.<p></p>
<b>Normal:</b> Regular attack roll modifiers for invisible attackers trying to hit you apply, and you lose your Dexterity bonus to AC. The speed reduction for darkness and poor visibility also applies.<p></p>

When you create a potion, you set the caster level, which must be sufficient to cast the spell in question and no higher than your own level. The base price of a potion is its spell level x \u61472?its caster level x \u61472?50 gp. To brew a potion, you must spend 1/25 of this base price in XP and use up raw materials costing one half this base price.<p></p>
When you create a potion, you make any choices that you would normally make when casting the spell. Whoever drinks the potion is the target of the spell.<p></p>
Any potion that stores a spell with a costly material component or an XP cost also carries a commensurate cost. In addition to the costs derived from the base price, you must expend the material component or pay the XP when creating the potion.<p></p>
<p></p>
CLEAVE [GENERAL]<p></p>
<b>Prerequisites:</b> Str 13, Power Attack.<p></p>
<b>Benefit:</b> If you deal a creature enough damage to make it drop (typically by dropping it to below 0 hit points or killing it), you get an immediate, extra melee attack against another creature within reach.

<b>Special:</b> A fighter may select Combat Expertise as one of his fighter bonus feats.<p></p>
<p></p>
COMBAT REFLEXES [GENERAL]<p></p>
<b>Benefit:</b> You may make a number of additional attacks of opportunity equal to your Dexterity bonus.<p></p>
With this feat, you may also make attacks of opportunity while flat-footed.<p></p>
<b>Normal:</b> A character without this feat can make only one attack of opportunity per round and can&rsquo;t make attacks of opportunity while flat-footed.<p></p>

You must make this decision as soon as you are reduced to negative hit points (even if it isn&rsquo;t your turn). If you do not choose to act as if you were disabled, you immediately fall unconscious.<p></p>
When using this feat, you can take either a single move or standard action each turn, but not both, and you cannot take a full round action. You can take a move action without further injuring yourself, but if you perform any standard action (or any other action deemed as strenuous, including some free actions, such as casting a quickened spell) you take 1 point of damage after completing the act.

<b>Special:</b> A fighter may select Dodge as one of his fighter bonus feats.<p></p>
<p></p>
EMPOWER SPELL [METAMAGIC]<p></p>
<b>Benefit:</b> All variable, numeric effects of an empowered spell are increased by one-half.<p></p>

<p></p>
ENLARGE SPELL [METAMAGIC]<p></p>
<b>Benefit:</b> You can alter a spell with a range of close, medium, or long to increase its range by 100%. An enlarged spell with a range of close now has a range of 50 ft. + 5 ft./level, while medium-range spells have a range of 200 ft. + 20 ft./level and long-range spells have a range of 800 ft. + 80 ft./level. An enlarged spell uses up a spell slot one level higher than the spell&rsquo;s actual level.<p></p>
Spells whose ranges are not defined by distance, as well as spells whose ranges are not close, medium, or long, do not have increased ranges.<p></p>
<p></p>
ESCHEW MATERIALS [GENERAL]<p></p>
<b>Benefit:</b> You can cast any spell that has a material component costing 1 gp or less without needing that component. (The casting of the spell still provokes attacks of opportunity as normal.) If the spell requires a material component that costs more than 1 gp, you must have the material component at hand to cast the spell, just as normal.<p></p>
<p></p>
EXOTIC WEAPON PROFICIENCY [GENERAL]<p></p>

EXTRA TURNING [GENERAL]<p></p>
<b>Prerequisite:</b> Ability to turn or rebuke creatures.<p></p>
<b>Benefit:</b> Each time you take this feat, you can use your ability to turn or rebuke creatures four more times per day than normal.<p></p>
If you have the ability to turn or rebuke more than one kind of creature each of your turning or rebuking abilities gains four additional uses per day.<p></p>
<b>Normal:</b> Without this feat, a character can typically turn or rebuke undead (or other creatures) a number of times per day equal to 3 + his or her Charisma modifier.<p></p>
<b>Special:</b> You can gain Extra Turning multiple times. Its effects stack. Each time you take the feat, you can use each of your turning or rebuking abilities four additional times per day.<p></p>
<p></p>
FAR SHOT [GENERAL]<p></p>
<b>Prerequisite:</b> Point Blank Shot.<p></p>

You can also mend a broken ring if it is one that you could make. Doing so costs half the XP, half the raw materials, and half the time it would take to forge that ring in the first place.<p></p>
Some magic rings incur extra costs in material components or XP, as noted in their descriptions. You must pay such a cost to forge such a ring or to mend a broken one.<p></p>
<p></p>
GREAT CLEAVE [GENERAL]<p></p>
<b>Prerequisites:</b> Str 13, Cleave, Power Attack, base attack bonus +4.<p></p>

<p></p>
HEIGHTEN SPELL [METAMAGIC]<p></p>
<b>Benefit:</b> A heightened spell has a higher spell level than normal (up to a maximum of 9th level). Unlike other metamagic feats, Heighten Spell actually increases the effective level of the spell that it modifies. All effects dependent on spell level (such as saving throw DCs and ability to penetrate a <i>lesser globe of invulnerability</i>) are calculated according to the heightened level. The heightened spell is as difficult to prepare and cast as a spell of its effective level. <p></p>

<p></p>
The list in the table above presents only a few possible improved familiars. Almost any creature of the same general size and power as those on the list makes a suitable familiar. Nor is the master&rsquo;s alignment the only possible categorization. For instance, improved familiars could be assigned by the master&rsquo;s creature type or subtype, as shown below.<p></p>
<p></p>

<b>Special:</b> A fighter may select Improved Precise Shot as one of his fighter bonus feats.<p></p>
An 11th-level ranger who has chosen the archery combat style is treated as having Improved Precise Shot, even if he does not have the prerequisites for it, but only when he is wearing light or no armor.<p></p>

<b>Benefit:</b> You get a +2 bonus on all Will saving throws.<p></p>
<p></p>
LEADERSHIP [GENERAL]<p></p>
<b>Prerequisite:</b> Character level 6th.<p></p>
<b>Benefits:</b> Having this feat enables the character to attract loyal companions and devoted followers, subordinates who assist her. See the table below for what sort of cohort and how many followers the character can recruit.<p></p>
<b>Leadership Modifiers: </b>Several factors can affect a character&rsquo;s Leadership score, causing it to vary from the base score (character level + Cha modifier). A character&rsquo;s reputation (from the point of view of the cohort or follower he is trying to attract) raises or lowers his Leadership score:<p></p>
<p></p>
<b>Leader</b>&rsquo;s Reputation <b>Modifier</b><b>Great renown </b>+2Fairness and generosity +1Special power +1Failure 1Aloofness 1Cruelty 2<p></p>
Other modifiers may apply when the character tries to attract a cohort:<p></p>
<b>The Leader . . . </b><b>Modifier</b><b>Has a familiar, special mount, or animal companion </b>2Recruits a cohort of a different alignment1Caused the death of a cohort 2** Cumulative per cohort killed.<p></p>
Followers have different priorities from cohorts. When the character tries to attract a new follower, use any of the following modifiers that apply.<p></p>
<b>The Leader . . . </b><b>Modifier</b><b>Has a stronghold, base of operations, guildhouse, or the like</b>+2Moves around a lot 1Caused the death of other followers 1.<p></p>
<b>Leadership Score</b>Cohort Level Number of Followers by Level <b>1st</b><b>2nd</b><b>3rd</b><b>4th</b><b>5th</b><b>6th</b><b>1 or lower</b>21st32nd43rd53rd64th75th85th96th107th5117th6128th8139th1011410th1511510th20211611th25211712th303111812th353111913th4042112014th5053212115th60632112215th75742212316th90953212417th11011632125 or higher17th135137422<p></p>
Leadership Score: A character&rsquo;s base Leadership score equals his level plus any Charisma modifier. In order to take into account negative Charisma modifiers, this table allows for very low Leadership scores, but the character must still be 6th level or higher in order to gain the Leadership feat. Outside factors can affect a character&rsquo;s Leadership score, as detailed above.<p></p>
<i>Cohort Level: </i>The character can attract a cohort of up to this level. Regardless of a character&rsquo;s Leadership score, he can only recruit a cohort who is two or more levels lower than himself. The cohort should be equipped with gear appropriate for its level. A character can try to attract a cohort of a particular race, class, and alignment. The cohort&rsquo;s alignment may not be opposed to the leader&rsquo;s alignment on either the law-vs-chaos or good-vs-evil axis, and the leader takes a Leadership penalty if he recruits a cohort of an alignment different from his own.<p></p>
Cohorts earn XP as follows:<p></p>
The cohort does not count as a party member when determining the party&rsquo;s XP.<p></p>
Divide the cohort&rsquo;s level by the level of the PC with whom he or she is associated (the character with the Leadership feat who attracted the cohort).<p></p>
Multiply this result by the total XP awarded to the PC and add that number of experience points to the cohort&rsquo;s total.<p></p>
If a cohort gains enough XP to bring it to a level one lower than the associated PC&rsquo;s character level, the cohort does not gain the new levelits new XP total is 1 less than the amount needed attain the next level. <p></p>
<p></p>
<i>Number of Followers by Level: </i>The character can lead up to the indicated number of characters of each level. Followers are similar to cohorts, except they&rsquo;re generally low-level NPCs. Because they&rsquo;re generally five or more levels behind the character they follow, they&rsquo;re rarely effective in combat.<p></p>
Followers don&rsquo;t earn experience and thus don&rsquo;t gain levels. However, when a character with Leadership attains a new level, the player consults the table above to determine if she has acquired more followers, some of which may be higher level than the existing followers. (You don&rsquo;t consult the table to see if your cohort gains levels, however, because cohorts earn experience on their own.)<p></p>
<p></p>
LIGHTNING REFLEXES [GENERAL]<p></p>
<b>Benefit:</b> You get a +2 bonus on all Reflex saving throws.<p></p>
<p></p>
MAGICAL APTITUDE [GENERAL]<p></p>
<b>Benefit:</b> You get a +2 bonus on all Spellcraft checks and Use Magic Device checks.<p></p>
<p></p>
MANYSHOT [GENERAL]<p></p>
<b>Prerequisites:</b> Dex 17, Point Blank Shot, Rapid Shot, base attack bonus +6<p></p>
<b>Benefit:</b> As a standard action, you may fire two arrows at a single opponent within 30 feet. Both arrows use the same attack roll (with a 4 penalty) to determine success and deal damage normally (but see Special).<p></p>
For every five points of base attack bonus you have above +6, you may add one additional arrow to this attack, to a maximum of four arrows at a base attack bonus of +16. However, each arrow after the second adds a cumulative 2 penalty on the attack roll (for a total penalty of 6 for three arrows and 8 for four).<p></p>
Damage reduction and other resistances apply separately against each arrow fired.<p></p>
<b>Special:</b> Regardless of the number of arrows you fire, you apply precision-based damage only once. If you score a critical hit, only the first arrow fired deals critical damage; all others deal regular damage.<p></p>
A fighter may select Manyshot as one of his fighter bonus feats.<p></p>
A 6th-level ranger who has chosen the archery combat style is treated as having Manyshot even if he does not have the prerequisites for it, but only when he is wearing light or no armor.<p></p>

MARTIAL WEAPON PROFICIENCY [GENERAL]<p></p>
Choose a type of martial weapon. You understand how to use that type of martial weapon in combat.<p></p>

<p></p>
MAXIMIZE SPELL [METAMAGIC]<p></p>
<b>Benefit:</b> All variable, numeric effects of a spell modified by this feat are maximized. Saving throws and opposed rolls are not affected, nor are spells without random variables. A maximized spell uses up a spell slot three levels higher than the spell&rsquo;s actual level.<p></p>
An empowered, maximized spell gains the separate benefits of each feat: the maximum result plus one-half the normally rolled result.<p></p>
<p></p>
MOBILITY [GENERAL]<p></p>
<b>Prerequisites:</b> Dex 13, Dodge.<p></p>
<b>Benefit:</b> You get a +4 dodge bonus to Armor Class against attacks of opportunity caused when you move out of or within a threatened area. A condition that makes you lose your Dexterity bonus to Armor Class (if any) also makes you lose dodge bonuses.<p></p>
Dodge bonuses stack with each other, unlike most types of bonuses.<p></p>
<b>Special:</b> A fighter may select Mobility as one of his fighter bonus feats.<p></p>
<p></p>
MOUNTED ARCHERY [GENERAL]<p></p>
<b>Prerequisites:</b> Ride 1 rank, Mounted Combat.<p></p>
<b>Benefit:</b> The penalty you take when using a ranged weapon while mounted is halved: 2 instead of 4 if your mount is taking a double move, and 4 instead of 8 if your mount is running.<p></p>
<b>Special:</b> A fighter may select Mounted Archery as one of his fighter bonus feats.<p></p>
<p></p>
MOUNTED COMBAT [GENERAL]<p></p>
<b>Prerequisite:</b> Ride 1 rank.<p></p>
<b>Benefit:</b> Once per round when your mount is hit in combat, you may attempt a Ride check (as a reaction) to negate the hit. The hit is negated if your Ride check result is greater than the opponent&rsquo;s attack roll. (Essentially, the Ride check result becomes the mount&rsquo;s Armor Class if it&rsquo;s higher than the mount&rsquo;s regular AC.)<p></p>
<b>Special:</b> A fighter may select Mounted Combat as one of his fighter bonus feats.<p></p>
<p></p>
NATURAL SPELL [GENERAL]<p></p>
<b>Prerequisites: </b>Wis 13, wild shape ability.<p></p>
<b>Benefit:</b> You can complete the verbal and somatic components of spells while in a wild shape. You substitute various noises and gestures for the normal verbal and somatic components of a spell.<p></p>
You can also use any material components or focuses you possess, even if such items are melded within your current form. This feat does not permit the use of magic items while you are in a form that could not ordinarily use them, and you do not gain the ability to speak while in a wild shape.<p></p>
<p></p>
NEGOTIATOR [GENERAL]<p></p>
<b>Benefit:</b> You get a +2 bonus on all Diplomacy checks and Sense Motive checks.<p></p>
<p></p>

<b>Special:</b> A fighter may select Point Blank Shot as one of his fighter bonus feats.<p></p>
<p></p>
POWER ATTACK [GENERAL]<p></p>
<b>Prerequisite:</b> Str 13.<p></p>
<b>Benefit:</b> On your action, before making attack rolls for a round, you may choose to subtract a number from all melee attack rolls and add the same number to all melee damage rolls. This number may not exceed your base attack bonus. The penalty on attacks and bonus on damage apply until your next turn.<p></p>
<b>Special:</b> If you attack with a two-handed weapon, or with a one-handed weapon wielded in two hands, instead add twice the number subtracted from your attack rolls. You can&rsquo;t add the bonus from Power Attack to the damage dealt with a light weapon (except with unarmed strikes or natural weapon attacks), even though the penalty on attack rolls still applies. (Normally, you treat a double weapon as a one-handed weapon and a light weapon. If you choose to use a double weapon like a two-handed weapon, attacking with only one end of it in a round, you treat it as a two-handed weapon.)<p></p>
A fighter may select Power Attack as one of his fighter bonus feats.<p></p>
<p></p>
PRECISE SHOT [GENERAL]<p></p>
<b>Prerequisite:</b> Point Blank Shot.<p></p>
<b>Benefit:</b> You can shoot or throw ranged weapons at an opponent engaged in melee without taking the standard 4 penalty on your attack roll.<p></p>

<p></p>
QUICK DRAW [GENERAL]<p></p>
<b>Prerequisite:</b> Base attack bonus +1.<p></p>
<b>Benefit:</b> You can draw a weapon as a free action instead of as a move action. You can draw a hidden weapon (see the Sleight of Hand skill) as a move action.<p></p>
A character who has selected this feat may throw weapons at his full normal rate of attacks (much like a character with a bow).<p></p>
<b>Normal: </b>Without this feat, you may draw a weapon as a move action, or (if your base attack bonus is +1 or higher) as a free action as part of movement. Without this feat, you can draw a hidden weapon as a standard action.<p></p>
<b>Special:</b> A fighter may select Quick Draw as one of his fighter bonus feats.<p></p>
<p></p>
QUICKEN SPELL [METAMAGIC]<p></p>
<b>Benefit:</b> Casting a quickened spell is a free action. You can perform another action, even casting another spell, in the same round as you cast a quickened spell. You may cast only one quickened spell per round. A spell whose casting time is more than 1 full round action cannot be quickened. A quickened spell uses up a spell slot four levels higher than the spell&rsquo;s actual level. Casting a quickened spell doesn&rsquo;t provoke an attack of opportunity.<p></p>
<b>Special:</b> This feat can&rsquo;t be applied to any spell cast spontaneously (including sorcerer spells, bard spells, and cleric or druid spells cast spontaneously), since applying a metamagic feat to a spontaneously cast spell automatically increases the casting time to a full-round action.<p></p>
<p></p>
RAPID RELOAD [GENERAL]<p></p>
Choose a type of crossbow (hand, light, or heavy).<p></p>
<b>Prerequisite:</b> Weapon Proficiency (crossbow type chosen).<p></p>
<b>Benefit:</b> The time required for you to reload your chosen type of crossbow is reduced to a free action (for a hand or light crossbow) or a move action (for a heavy crossbow). Reloading a crossbow still provokes an attack of opportunity.<p></p>
If you have selected this feat for hand crossbow or light crossbow, you may fire that weapon as many times in a full attack action as you could attack if you were using a bow.<p></p>
<b>Normal:</b> A character without this feat needs a move action to reload a hand or light crossbow, or a full-round action to reload a heavy crossbow. <p></p>
<b>Special:</b> You can gain Rapid Reload multiple times. Each time you take the feat, it applies to a new type of crossbow.<p></p>
A fighter may select Rapid Reload as one of his fighter bonus feats.<p></p>
<p></p>
RAPID SHOT [GENERAL]<p></p>
<b>Prerequisites:</b> Dex 13, Point Blank Shot.<p></p>
<b>Benefit:</b> You can get one extra attack per round with a ranged weapon. The attack is at your highest base attack bonus, but each attack you make in that round (the extra one and the normal ones) takes a 2 penalty. You must use the full attack action to use this feat.<p></p>
<b>Special:</b> A fighter may select Rapid Shot as one of his fighter bonus feats.<p></p>
A 2nd-level ranger who has chosen the archery combat style is treated as having Rapid Shot, even if he does not have the prerequisites for it, but only when he is wearing light or no armor.<p></p>
<p></p>
RIDE-BY ATTACK [GENERAL]<p></p>
<b>Prerequisites:</b> Ride 1 rank, Mounted Combat.<p></p>
<b>Benefit:</b> When you are mounted and use the charge action, you may move and attack as if with a standard charge and then move again (continuing the straight line of the charge). Your total movement for the round can&rsquo;t exceed double your mounted speed. You and your mount do not provoke an attack of opportunity from the opponent that you attack.<p></p>
<b>Special:</b> A fighter may select Ride-By Attack as one of his fighter bonus feats.<p></p>
<p></p>
RUN [GENERAL]<p></p>
<b>Benefit:</b> When running, you move five times your normal speed (if wearing medium, light, or no armor and carrying no more than a medium load) or four times your speed (if wearing heavy armor or carrying a heavy load). If you make a jump after a running start (see the Jump skill description), you gain a +4 bonus on your Jump check. While running, you retain your Dexterity bonus to AC.<p></p>
<b>Normal:</b> You move four times your speed while running (if wearing medium, light, or no armor and carrying no more than a medium load) or three times your speed (if wearing heavy armor or carrying a heavy load), and you lose your Dexterity bonus to AC.<p></p>
<p></p>
SCRIBE SCROLL [ITEM CREATION]<p></p>
<b>Prerequisite:</b> Caster level 1st.<p></p>
<b>Benefit:</b> You can create a scroll of any spell that you know. Scribing a scroll takes one day for each 1,000 gp in its base price. The base price of a scroll is its spell level x \u61472?its caster level x \u61472?25 gp. To scribe a scroll, you must spend 1/25 of this base price in XP and use up raw materials costing one-half of this base price.<p></p>
Any scroll that stores a spell with a costly material component or an XP cost also carries a commensurate cost. In addition to the costs derived from the base price, you must expend the material component or pay the XP when scribing the scroll.<p></p>
<p></p>
SELF-SUFFICIENT [GENERAL]<p></p>
<b>Benefit:</b> You get a +2 bonus on all Heal checks and Survival checks.<p></p>
<p></p>

<p></p>

<b>Benefit:</b> A silent spell can be cast with no verbal components. Spells without verbal components are not affected. A silent spell uses up a spell slot one level higher than the spell&rsquo;s actual level.<p></p>
<b>Special:</b> Bard spells cannot be enhanced by this metamagic feat.<p></p>
<p></p>
SIMPLE WEAPON PROFICIENCY [GENERAL]<p></p>

<b>Normal:</b> When using a weapon with which you are not proficient, you take a 4 penalty on attack rolls.<p></p>

You must have at least one hand free (holding nothing) to use this feat.<p></p>
<b>Special:</b> A fighter may select Snatch Arrows as one of his fighter bonus feats.<p></p>

<p></p>
SPRING ATTACK [GENERAL]<p></p>
<b>Prerequisites:</b> Dex 13, Dodge, Mobility, base attack bonus +4.<p></p>
<b>Benefit:</b> When using the attack action with a melee weapon, you can move both before and after the attack, provided that your total distance moved is not greater than your speed. Moving in this way does not provoke an attack of opportunity from the defender you attack, though it might provoke attacks of opportunity from other creatures, if appropriate. You can&rsquo;t use this feat if you are wearing heavy armor.<p></p>

<p></p>
STUNNING FIST [GENERAL]<p></p>
<b>Prerequisites:</b> Dex 13, Wis 13, Improved Unarmed Strike, base attack bonus +8.<p></p>
<b>Benefit:</b> You must declare that you are using this feat before you make your attack roll (thus, a failed attack roll ruins the attempt). Stunning Fist forces a foe damaged by your unarmed attack to make a Fortitude saving throw (DC 10 + 1/2 your character level + your Wis modifier), in addition to dealing damage normally. A defender who fails this saving throw is stunned for 1 round (until just before your next action). A stunned character can&rsquo;t act, loses any Dexterity bonus to AC, and takes a 2 penalty to AC. You may attempt a stunning attack once per day for every four levels you have attained (but see Special), and no more than once per round. Constructs, oozes, plants, undead, incorporeal creatures, and creatures immune to critical hits cannot be stunned.<p></p>
<b>Special:</b> A monk may select Stunning Fist as a bonus feat at 1st level, even if she does not meet the prerequisites. A monk who selects this feat may attempt a stunning attack a number of times per day equal to her monk level, plus one more time per day for every four levels she has in classes other than monk.<p></p>
A fighter may select Stunning Fist as one of his fighter bonus feats.<p></p>

<b>Special:</b> Fighters automatically have Tower Shield Proficiency as a bonus feat. They need not select it.<p></p>
<p></p>
TRACK [GENERAL]<p></p>
<b>Benefit:</b> To find tracks or to follow them for 1 mile requires a successful Survival check. You must make another Survival check every time the tracks become difficult to follow.<p></p>
You move at half your normal speed (or at your normal speed with a 5 penalty on the check, or at up to twice your normal speed with a 20 penalty on the check). The DC depends on the surface and the prevailing conditions, as given on the table below:<p></p>
<p></p>
<b>Surface</b>Survival DC Surface Survival DC<b>Very soft ground </b>5 Firm ground 15Soft ground 10 Hard ground 20<p></p>
<i>Very Soft Ground: </i>Any surface (fresh snow, thick dust, wet mud) that holds deep, clear impressions of footprints.<p></p>
<i>Soft Ground: </i>Any surface soft enough to yield to pressure, but firmer than wet mud or fresh snow, in which a creature leaves frequent but shallow footprints.<p></p>
<i>Firm Ground: </i>Most normal outdoor surfaces (such as lawns, fields, woods, and the like) or exceptionally soft or dirty indoor surfaces (thick rugs and very dirty or dusty floors). The creature might leave some traces (broken branches or tufts of hair), but it leaves only occasional or partial footprints.<p></p>
<i>Hard Ground: </i>Any surface that doesn&rsquo;t hold footprints at all, such as bare rock or an indoor floor. Most streambeds fall into this category, since any footprints left behind are obscured or washed away. The creature leaves only traces (scuff marks or displaced pebbles). <p></p>
Several modifiers may apply to the Survival check, as given on the table below.<p></p>
<p></p>
<b>Condition </b>Survival DC Modifier<b>Every three creatures in the group being tracked </b>1Size of creature or creatures being tracked:<b>1</b><b>Fine </b>+8Diminutive +4Tiny +2Small +1Medium +0Large 1Huge 2Gargantuan 4Colossal 8Every 24 hours since the trail was made +1Every hour of rain since the trail was made +1Fresh snow cover since the trail was made +10Poor visibility:<b>2</b><b>Overcast or moonless night </b>+6Moonlight +3Fog or precipitation +3Tracked party hides trail (and moves at half speed) +51 For a group of mixed sizes, apply only the modifier for the largest size category.2 Apply only the largest modifier from this category.<p></p>
If you fail a Survival check, you can retry after 1 hour (outdoors) or 10 minutes (indoors) of searching.<p></p>
<b>Normal:</b> Without this feat, you can use the Survival skill to find tracks, but you can follow them only if the DC for the task is 10 or lower. Alternatively, you can use the Search skill to find a footprint or similar sign of a creature&rsquo;s passage using the DCs given above, but you can&rsquo;t use Search to follow tracks, even if someone else has already found them.<p></p>
<b>Special:</b> A ranger automatically has Track as a bonus feat. He need not select it.<p></p>
This feat does not allow you to find or follow the tracks made by a subject of a <i>pass without trace </i>spell.<p></p>

When fighting in this way you suffer a 6 penalty with your regular attack or attacks with your primary hand and a 10 penalty to the attack with your off hand. If your off-hand weapon is light the penalties are reduced by 2 each. (An unarmed strike is always considered light.)<p></p>
